# Wordle-Clone-But-Worse

TODO: The user name is not being sent to the new activity FIX!!!

I have created the base of the Wordle-Clone-But-Worse app.

I have used two activities, the main gets the user name and then when the button is clicked it sends the user to the game

The game contains 5 Buttons (Could find a better component to use but was lazy) which displays the word to the person. The buttons also displays each letter the user guess if it matches and if shows the user the correct location of the letter.
